# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-18)

**Core value:** Users never miss a price drop on products they care about — regardless of which e-commerce site the product lives on.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-database

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-database) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 5

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Firecrawl) marked as needing `/gsd-research-phase` — Firecrawl SDK exact API shape is MEDIUM confidence
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Cron+Email) marked as needing `/gsd-research-phase` — Supabase Vault SQL syntax + p-limit ESM compatibility need live verification
- [Roadmap]: DB schema and RLS must land simultaneously in Phase 1 — retrofit is rated "never acceptable as technical debt"
- [Roadmap]: Resend domain DNS setup should begin at Phase 5 start (48h propagation window before Phase 6 needs it)
- [Phase 01]: Permissive images.remotePatterns wildcard (https + http) for v1 — strict allowlist deferred to Phase 7
- [Phase 01]: .env.local seeded with 48-char CRON_SECRET placeholder so build passes before real secret in Plan 03
- [Phase 01]: Admin client line 1 is literally 'import server-only' (comment moved to line 2) to satisfy stricter awk-exact acceptance criterion
- [Phase 01]: proxy.ts keeps typed NextRequest param even though unused in stub — Phase 2 consumes it for session refresh (ESLint warning is intentional)
- [Phase 01]: Supabase project vhlbdcsxccaknccawfdj (dealdrop-dev, Tokyo) linked via CLI access-token flow; three migrations authored but deferred to Plan 04 for atomic push

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 depends on Resend domain DNS propagation (up to 48h) — begin domain setup at Phase 5 start, not Phase 6 start
- Verify `p-limit` ESM/CJS compatibility with Next.js 16 + Turbopack before Phase 6 implementation
- Confirm Firecrawl SDK parameter shape (`formats: ['extract']` vs `extractorOptions`) before Phase 3 implementation
